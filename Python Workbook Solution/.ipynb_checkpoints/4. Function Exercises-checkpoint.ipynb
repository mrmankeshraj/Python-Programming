    "### Exercise 103: Magic Dates\n",
    "(Solved—26 Lines)\n",
    "A magic date is a date where the day multiplied by the month is equal to the two digit year. For example, June 10, 1960 is a magic date because June is the sixth month, and 6 times 10 is 60, which is equal to the two digit year. Write a function that determines whether or not a date is a magic date. Use your function to create a main program that finds and displays all of the magic dates in the 20th century. You will probably find your solution to Exercise 100 helpful when completing this exercise."
