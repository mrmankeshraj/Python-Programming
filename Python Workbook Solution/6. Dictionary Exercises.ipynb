You should demonstrate your function with at least one card with a horizontal line, at least one card with a vertical line, at least one card with a diagonal line, and at least one card that has some numbers crossed out but does not contain a winning line.

    "In this exercise you will write a program that simulates a game of Bingo for a single card. Begin by generating a list of all of the valid Bingo calls (B1 through O75). Once the list has been created you can randomize the order of its elements by calling the shuffle function in the random module. Then your program should consume calls out of the list, crossing out numbers on the card, until the card contains a crossed out line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal). Simulate 1,000 games and report the minimum, maximum and average number of calls that must be made before the card wins. Import your solutions to Exercises 138 and 139 when completing this exercise."
