A spell checker can be a helpful tool for people who struggle to spell words correctly.
In this exercise, you will write a program that reads a file and displays all of the words in it that are misspelled.
Misspelled words will be identified by checking each word in the file against a list of known words.
Any words in the user’s file that do not appear in the list of known words will be reported as spelling mistakes.
The user will provide the name of the file to check for spelling mistakes as a command line parameter.
Your program should display an appropriate error message if the command line parameter is missing.
An error message should also be displayed if your program is unable to open the user’s file.
Use your solution to Exercise 111 when creating your solution to this exercise so that words followed by a comma, period or other punctuation mark are not reported as spelling mistakes.
Ignore the capitalization of the words when checking their spelling.
Hint: While you could load all of the English words from the words data set into a list, searching a list is slow if you use Python’s in operator.
It is much faster to check if a key is present in a dictionary, or if a value is present in a set.
If you use a dictionary, the words will be the keys. The values can be the integer 0 (or any other value) because the values will never be used.
