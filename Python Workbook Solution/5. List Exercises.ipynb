If an English word begins with an uppercase letter then its Pig Latin representation should also begin with an uppercase letter and the uppercase letter moved to the end of the word should be changed to lowercase. For example, Computer should become Omputercay. If a word ends in a punctuation mark then the punctuation mark should remain at the end of the word after the transformation has been performed. For example, Science! should become Iencescay!."

This is also an easy task for a computer—a for loop can simulate this behavior when a third parameter is provided to the range function. When a number is crossed out, we know that it is no longer prime, but it still occupies space on the piece of paper, and must still be considered when computing later prime numbers. As a result, you should not simulate crossing out a number by removing it from the list. Instead, you should simulate crossing out a number by replacing it with 0. Then, once the algorithm completes, all of the non-zero values in the list are prime.\n",
