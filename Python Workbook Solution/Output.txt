1: A spell checker can be a helpful tool for people who struggle to spell words correctly.
2: In this exercise, you will write a program that reads a file and displays all of the words in it that are misspelled.
3: Misspelled words will be identified by checking each word in the file against a list of known words.
4: Any words in the user’s file that do not appear in the list of known words will be reported as spelling mistakes.
5: The user will provide the name of the file to check for spelling mistakes as a command line parameter.
6: Your program should display an appropriate error message if the command line parameter is missing.
7: An error message should also be displayed if your program is unable to open the user’s file.
8: Use your solution to Exercise 111 when creating your solution to this exercise so that words followed by a comma, period or other punctuation mark are not reported as spelling mistakes.
9: Ignore the capitalization of the words when checking their spelling.
10: Hint: While you could load all of the English words from the words data set into a list, searching a list is slow if you use Python’s in operator.
11: It is much faster to check if a key is present in a dictionary, or if a value is present in a set.
12: If you use a dictionary, the words will be the keys. The values can be the integer 0 (or any other value) because the values will never be used.
